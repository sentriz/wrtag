# custom tag diff weights can be provided to customise how the scoring algorithm weights certain tags when diffing. the default weight of any
# tag is 1, so provide a float <1 for less weight, and >1 for more weight. a weight of 0 means ignore the tag completely.
# like any other array like config option, it can be repeated for multiple diff weights

#diff-weight media format 0.5
#diff-weight catalogue num 1.2

# custom tag configs specify rules to change the tag set which is written by wrtag. by default, all tags are dropped, the default set is written,
# then some are kept from the previous tags (for example replaygain settings, lyrics, comments, and encoder tags). to extend the list
# of tags which are kept, add use the `keep` operation. to not write any tags from the default set, or overwrite the default keep list, use
# `drop` operation

#tag-config keep my_tag
#tag-config keep my_other_tag
#tag-config drop genre
#tag-config drop genres

# addons add external metadata to tracks after a musicbrainz match. can be used when importing for web, sync cli, or normal cli.
